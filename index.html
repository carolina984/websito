    <h1>Welcome to my blog!</h1>
    <p>My name is Carolina, and I used to be a feral bug collector as a kid.</p>
    <p>I like old stuff. I feel myself being transported to another time whenever I touch something from the past. I’ll read an old love letter, and suddenly I’m there — filled to the top with feelings that seem to have been precisely engraved on that little souvenir.
    Maybe you’ve felt this too — like a moment can be perfectly preserved, just waiting to be touched again.</p>
    I suppose you could say I’m a little nostalgic.
  Maybe that’s why I’m so interested in capturing my memories — because the world feels more real that way. Because I can keep all of it, and nothing gets lost to the passage of time.</p>
    <p>Lately, life has been so good, and I have so much I don’t want to lose. This blog is where I’ll keep some of my trinkets: my texts full of the present, of reality, and of the <i>me</i> I’m currently so fond of.</p>
    <p>I hope you’ll stay a bit :] </p>
